       <p>
       Communication and public speaking go hand in hand. Being able to convey information to people whether it's to individuals or groups is vital. Along with being able to stand in front of people and not get lost in your nerves.For myself, doing this has been a staple in my life. From performing in musicals,  presenting assemblies,and helping my father dricert his workers. When helping my dad with the information I had  to give out, not only did I have  to share it with a group of people almost daily, I also had to translate it. So making sure the information is repeated loudly and clearly enough for the group to hear it but to also translate it to the best of my understanding without information getting lost in translation and giving direction . Being in front of 40-50 if not people isn't always easy, espacily the days where you were the bearer of bad news and had to tell them that we have no work for the day or when you were under a light by yourself singing a song about a blank.
With the motivation of staff and students at year up along with my previous experiences and skills. I hope it  will lead me to be  part of a team in pursuit of a goal.
